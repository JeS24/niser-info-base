#### Rules for New Posts & Edits [WIP]

1. Keep posts & attached documents and details limited to NISER academic/admin processes. For example, for a visa, you may need an NOC from NISER. So, a post detailing all the visa steps is off-topic, but the steps regarding just the NOC, including mentioning an NOC letter format, is on-topic.
2. Always include dates/times where necessary, so that the context is clear for future readers and to help with updating the post with future changes (also to maintain a timeline, in some cases).
3. Do not include personal or work email IDs / contact information of people whose IDs aren't already public, e.g., on [NISER's website](https://www.niser.ac.in/people/adm). Names are okay. Emails can be found via NISER Mail.
4. No controversial topics or unwarranted snark in the posts or attempts at chronicling NISER's many controversies. This is supposed to be a focused knowledge base, not a historical record.
5. _More to be added_
